\chapter{Introduction}

ZTile is a library designed for handling square and hexagonal tiles in a game map.

\section{Terminology}

A map is made up of square or hexagonal \textbf{tiles}.

\section{GHCi}

You can test out some of the random graphs generated by ZTile by invoking GHCi on the \ct{ZTile.Test} module as follows:

\begin{console}
ZTile.Test> :m +Data.GraphViz
ZTile.Test> rng <- createSystemRandom
ZTile.Test> g <- randWGraph 10 0.3 [] rng :: IO (Gr Int Int)
ZTile.Test> preview g
\end{console}

This will create a random graph of 10 vertices, with each vertex having a 30\% probability of having edges to all other vertices in the graph, and will output that graph with GraphViz's \ct{preview} function, which pretty-prints the graph in a window using vector graphics.
You can move around the graph with your mouse's middle mouse button, and also zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.
